# grunt-nsp
> Checks your package.json / npm-shrinkwrap.json against the Node Security (+) API for dependencies with known vulnerabilities.


## Getting Started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.

Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-nsp --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  nsp: {
    package: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json')
  }
});

grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-nsp');
```

## Options
This package supports the following options.

- package (object): The contents of a single package.json file [required]
- shrinkwrap (object): The contents of a single npm-shrinkwrap.json file (optional, but is a much more efficient check)
- output (string): Adjust the output format to any formatter supported by [nsp](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp)

## Command Line Options

--package
Path to a package.json file
Example `grunt nsp --package ./package.json`

--shrinkwrap
Path to a npm-shrinkwrap.json file
Example `grunt nsp --shrinkwrap ./npm-shrinkwrap.json`

--output
nsp output formatter to use
Example `grunt nsp --package ./package.json --output summary`
